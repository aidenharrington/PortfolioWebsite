        "title": "About Me",
        "paragraph1": "Hi there! I’m Aiden Harrington, a software engineer based in Vancouver. After earning my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UBC, I blend my passion for software development with my love for hockey (Go Canucks!), reading, gaming, road biking, spending time with my girlfriend, and hanging out with my cuddly black cat, Stanley.",
        "paragraph2": "What really excites me about software development is the problem-solving aspect and my fascination with technology, especially when I was first introduced and software felt like magic to me. My curiosity about how code could create the incredible applications I used is what led me here, and there’s something incredibly rewarding about building apps and tools that people actually use and enjoy.",
        "paragraph3": "In my professional experience, I’ve found great fulfillment in mentoring others and leading projects that make a meaningful impact. I’ve had the opportunity to mentor several interns which has been a tremendously rewarding experience. Helping others grow and guiding them through challenges has helped me learn more about my strengths and weaknesses as well as deepening my understanding of team dynamics and the importance of clear communication. Leading projects has also been a major learning experience for me. It helped me better understand the business side of software development by immersing myself in the challenges of project planning, collaborating with different partners, and balancing the priorities of multiple teams.",
        "paragraph4": "Whether it's hitting a new biking milestone or diving into the latest tech, I’m always looking for ways to grow and push myself further. I’m excited to keep learning, and I’d love to connect with others who share that same passion."

            "titleContinued": "PayPal Continued",
            "date": "May 2022 - March 2024",
            "paragraph1": "At PayPal, I was part of a backend onboarding team that primarily worked on our Java Spring Boot API entry point for our large partners to onboard their merchant accounts. While working on this team, we reduced partner onboarding time by 75% and cut merchant onboarding time by over 50%. I also had the privilege of taking on several mentorship and leadership roles. The most rewarding of these experiences was guiding our intern through his first ever internship and working with him to deliver a completed project by the end of his term.",
            "paragraph2": "One of my first large solo projects was revamping a Spring Batch daemon. When I inherited the project, it was essentially a proof of concept that was built as part of an internship project, lacking documentation and structure. In order to get the project to production-ready status, I refactored a large part of the logic so the daemon could seamlessly switch between several jobs (and remain open for future use-cases) as well as implemented a retry and error logging mechanism. On its first production run, the daemon processed over 100,000 accounts with all errors handled by the retry mechanism and completed the job in under 20% of the expected time. I also created comprehensive documentation for the application and full run instructions for each of the jobs. To ensure seamless adoption across our North American and China teams, I hosted several demos and Q&A sessions to ensure that everyone on the team could use and develop within the application.",
            "paragraph3": "Another highlight at PayPal was leading the implementation (for the onboarding team) of a webhook-based alert mechanism in collaboration with multiple teams. This feature was requested by a key partner to enhance client communication during onboarding and faced a lot of internal and external pressure. To deliver the feature within tight timelines, I worked with our architect and product managers to build the product’s technical requirements alongside three other teams across as many countries. While we had to overcome many hurdles, we were able to deliver the feature by the deadline."

            "date": "May 2021 - Aug 2021",
            "paragraph1": "During my time at Knoldus, I primarily worked on an internal employee leaderboard and rewards page that consisted of an Angular frontend, Scala backend, and PostgreSQL database. One of my first contributions was refactoring the database migration scripts and automating the process with Flyway.",
            "paragraph2": "My largest project was building a web page to display a team-based leaderboard (to add to the existing individual employee leaderboard). To do this, I worked with our project manager and design team to create the technical specifications and visual design. Since employees’ teams were not currently tracked, I added and altered several database tables to represent the team entity and its relationships, created additional API endpoints and flows, and built a new frontend page to display the data retrieved from the new endpoints.",
            "paragraph3": "The leaderboard application not only streamlined the rewards tracking process within the company, but the application was also proposed to other businesses as a marketable SaaS solution for internal employee tracking. ",
            "paragraph4": "Beyond coding, I mentored junior interns, conducted code reviews, and presented team updates—including Spring-related developments—to both the manager and CEO."

            "date": "Sep 2019 - Aug 2020",
            "paragraph1": "My first internship was with Mitacs where I contributed to their Research and Applications Portal (RAP) which served as a webtool for researchers to submit their applications for research grants. Working in a small, dynamic team, I handled UI updates, database modifications, API endpoint development, and logic refinements across both frontend and backend applications.",
            "paragraph2": "A key achievement was building a scheduled daemon that synchronized data across various company systems, including Azure, SharePoint, and a MySQL database. The daemon ensured consistent and accurate data flow by identifying discrepancies, updating records, and automating a previously manual and tedious process."
